This summer, I would be contributing to the library Gensim as part of Google Summer of Code 2017.

I would be posting regular updates on Gensim's wordpress blog. You can view my first blog [here](https://rare-technologies.com/google-summer-of-code-2017-week-1-on-integrating-gensim-with-scikit-learn-and-keras/).

Hoping for an exciting summer! :) Cheers!
