This summer, I would be contributing to the library Gensim as part of Google Summer of Code 2017.

I would be posting regular updates on Gensim's wordpress blog. You can view my first blog : [here](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/2017/proposals/Chinmaya_Pancholi.md).

Hoping for an exciting summer! :) Cheers!
