I am applying for Google Summer of Code, 2017. It is an annual program sponsored
by Google, that pays students to contribute to open source organizations of
their choice. I have planned to apply to the library Gensim!

I am proposing to integrate Gensim with scikit-learn and Keras. You can look at my full proposal [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2015-Application--Shivam-Vats-:-Series-expansions)

I welcome your suggestions.

Cheers!
