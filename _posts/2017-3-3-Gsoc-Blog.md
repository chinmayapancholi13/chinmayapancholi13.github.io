I am applying for Google Summer of Code, 2017. It is an annual program sponsored
by Google, that pays students to contribute to open source organizations of
their choice. I have planned to apply to the library Gensim, under the umbrella organization NumFocus.

I am proposing to integrate Gensim with scikit-learn and Keras. You could see my proposal [here](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/pull/230).

I welcome your suggestions.

Cheers!
