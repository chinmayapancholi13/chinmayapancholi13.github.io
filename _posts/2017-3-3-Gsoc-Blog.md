I am applying for Google Summer of Code, 2017. It is an annual program sponsored
by Google, that pays students to contribute to open source organizations of
their choice. I have planned to apply to the library Gensim, under the umbrella organization NumFocus.

I am proposing to integrate Gensim with scikit-learn and Keras. I would soon be uploading my proposal here!

I welcome your suggestions.

Cheers!
