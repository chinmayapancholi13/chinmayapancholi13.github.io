This summer, I would be contributing to the library [Gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) as part of Google Summer of Code 2017 working with the organization [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org/).

I would also be posting regular updates on Gensim's wordpress blog. You can view my live blog [here](https://rare-technologies.com/chinmayas-google-summer-of-code-2017-live-blog-a-chronicle-of-integrating-gensim-with-scikit-learn-and-keras/).

Hoping for an exciting summer. Cheers! :)
