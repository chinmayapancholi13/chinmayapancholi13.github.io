I am a final year undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian
Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. My academic intersts include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing 
and Algorithm Design.
Besides this, I try to keep up with the latest developments in the world of politics and Cricket.


During the summer of 2017, I worked with the topic-modelling and information-extraction library [Gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) as part of the Google Summer of Code program. My project had two parts: integrating Gensim with the libraries scikit-learn & Keras and adding a Python implementation of Facebook Research's fastText model to Gensim. A detailed summary of the work that I did for GSoC can be found [here](https://rare-technologies.com/chinmayas-gsoc-2017-summary-integration-with-sklearn-keras-and-implementing-fasttext/).


I was simultaneously interning at the [Natural Language Processing Lab](http://natlang.cs.sfu.ca/) at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby where I worked under the guidance of [Prof. Anoop Sarkar](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop) on the project *Wikipedia Text Processor* where we mined English Wikipedia to extract and model historical information which was then used to classify new unseen chunks of text as *Historical* or *Not historical*. The system could also be generalised to work with any category of information (other than *historical data*) which the user considers *interesting*.


I have also worked with the pregnancy monitoring startup [PregBuddy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pregbuddy) where I developed an assistant for Facebook Messenger and Google Home. Recently, PregBuddy has been shortlisted for [Google's Launchpad Accelarator program](https://yourstory.com/2017/07/google-launchpad-build-women-entrepreneurs/) as well as for [Facebook's FbStart program](https://developers.facebook.com/fbstart).


During the summer of 2016, I worked with [Nomura](http://www.nomura.com/) as a Quantitative Analyst. My work involved developing a system to allow users to independently modify trade and market settings and help them visualize the changes in risk values as a result of these modifications. I also worked on a project to compute and implement bond convexity calculations for certain market settings.
